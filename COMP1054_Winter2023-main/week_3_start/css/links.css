/* STYLING LINKS  */

/* NOTES 

Link States

Links can exist in different states & can be styled uing different pseudo-classes 

Link: A link that has a destination (i.e., not just a named anchor), styled using the :link pseudo class.

Visited: A link that has already been visited (exists in the browser's history), styled using the :visited pseudo class.

Hover: A link that is hovered over by a user's mouse pointer, styled using the :hover pseudo class.

Focus: A link that is focused (e.g., moved to by a keyboard user using the Tab key or something similar, or programmatically focused using HTMLElement.focus()) â€” this is styled using the :focus pseudo class.

Active: A link that is activated (e.g., clicked on), styled using the :active pseudo class.

*/

/* DEFAULT STYLES 

Before we style the links, check out the default styling being applied. 
Open the page in several browsers - are the styles consistent across browsers? 
Remember - users are used to the defaults, so we can't stray too from these styles as users may be confused
