                    <em>Welcome to Week Two!</em>
                    Now that we've covered the absolute basics (what CSS is, what we can do with it, and how to include
                    it in our HTML documents), we're going to delve a little deeper into how CSS works. To really
                    understand CSS and why certain style rules are applied, it's important to understand the fundamental
                    concepts of the cascade, inheritance, and specificity.

                <p>
                    This week, we'll also explore some of the trickier selectors including pseudo-elements and classes,
                    and combinators.
                    Finally, we'll also spend some time this week talking about best practices - how to organize your
                    CSS, how to format your CSS, normalization/reset techniques, and helpful tools to optimize your
                    stylesheets.
